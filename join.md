## Member Eligibility

Membership in the Union Square Neighborhood Council is open to anyone who has **lived, worked, owned property, or owned a business** in the [Union Square neighborhood boundaries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/union-square-neighborhood-council/unionsquareneighborhoodcouncil.org/master/unionsquareboundaries.png) at any point within the last 12 months.

If you don't meet these eligibility requirements, you can still participate in meetings and discussions as a non-member, but you can't vote.

## Membership Form
