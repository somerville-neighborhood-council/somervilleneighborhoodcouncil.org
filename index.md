## WHAT IS IT?

The Union Square Neighborhood Council Working Group has come to agreement to initiate the formation of a Neighborhood Council. The community will elect a fifteen member interim founding board will serve for one year. In that time the Interim Board will be responsible for, among other things, leading the process of creating permanent Union Square Neighborhood Council bylaws and structure. 

The Working Group has established interim bylaws to guide the Neighborhood Council in its first year. 

Now that the Union Square Neighborhood Council Working Group has agreed to the interim bylaws and structure, this is Our Process for moving forward:

1. USNC-WG holds a broad community meeting, at which USNC is presented, a vote is held to ratify interim board formation, elections committee is established, board candidates solicited, and the election announced.
2. The USNC Interim Board Election is held.
3. Two weeks later the newly elected Board will hold the first Union Square Neighborhood Council Meeting. 


## VISION

Our Vision for Union Square is a thriving, engaged, enjoyable, inclusive, sustainable, diverse urban neighborhood and vibrant commercial center. 


## MISSION

Our Mission is to shape the future of Union Square as an increasingly inclusive and vibrant neighborhood and commercial center built around the aspirations of the people who live and work here. 

## VALUES

Our Values are interdependence, inclusion, wellness, participation, equity, enjoyment, stewardship, transparency and civic engagement.


## GOALS

Our Goals are to build community, empower members of the community, minimize displacement and promote affordability, increase economic opportunity, and steward the public realm and built environment. Furthermore, the Union Sq. Neighborhood Council aspires to be representative of the demographics of the community in Union Square. Our ideal board is comprised of at least 50% women and at least 27% people of color just like our neighborhood. We recognize these goals are aspirational however we do ask that all candidates for board be committed to the above and think creatively about how to achieve it for the USNC.
