## ABOUT THE PROPOSED COUNCIL

## VISION

Our Vision for Union Square is a thriving, engaged, enjoyable, inclusive, sustainable, diverse urban neighborhood and vibrant commercial center. 


## MISSION

Our Mission is to shape the future of Union Square as an increasingly inclusive and vibrant neighborhood and commercial center built around the aspirations of the people who live and work here. 

## VALUES

Our Values are interdependence, inclusion, wellness, participation, equity, enjoyment, stewardship, transparency and civic engagement.


## GOALS

Our Goals are to build community, empower members of the community, minimize displacement and promote affordability, increase economic opportunity, and steward the public realm and built environment. Furthermore, the Union Sq. Neighborhood Council aspires to be representative of the demographics of the community in Union Square. Our ideal board is comprised of at least 50% women and at least 27% people of color just like our neighborhood. We recognize these goals are aspirational however we do ask that all candidates for board be committed to the above and think creatively about how to achieve it for the USNC. 


## WHO ARE WE?

The Neighborhood Council Working Group is:

* Open to anyone with an interest in the future of Union Square
* Owners, renters, business owners, workers, artists, seniors, members of LOCUS and CAC. 
* Establishing our own protocols and democratic processes
* A forum for discussing ordinances that will affect Union Square
* Including Zoning Overlay, MLDA, CBO
* Developing Structure, Bylaws, Ratification and Election processes for a formalized, elected Neighborhood Council
