## What is the Neighborhood Council?

**The redevelopment that will transform our neighborhood is just beginning.** Residents, business people, and city officials have been working together to create a Neighborhood Council to influence this transformation.

* [USNC Public discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/usnc-public) - This forum is open to all. All posts are publicly visible. If you want to post, you must join the group by clicking the blue button that says "Apply to join group". **All applications will be approved; this is just to control spam, and is not any sort of "screen" on applicants.**

## Committees

One of the first acts of the new Board will be to form committees to address specific neighborhood and council needs. Stay tuned to this space to learn about the committees that will be created - and then join one if you're interested and want to help out!
