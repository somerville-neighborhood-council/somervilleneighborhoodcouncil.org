<span style="color:red">Special announcement: Once voting is complete, ballots will be tabulated by Election Committee volunteers and results will be posted here, sent to the <a href="http://tinyletter.com/unionsquareneighborhoodcouncil">newsletter subscribers</a>, and posted on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/USNCWG/">Facebook page</a> as promptly as possible. This process will take a little while due to careful counting and cross-referencing - so depending on turnout they might not be posted this evening - but rest assured that they will be made available as soon as the count is complete. Thanks for your patience and thank you for voting!</span>
