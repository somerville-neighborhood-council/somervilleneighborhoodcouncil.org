| Aaron Weber    | Homeowner, organization member, open seat         | Union Square redevelopment offers us the opportunity to shape the neighborhood for decades to come. It also poses risks: it can be too fast or too slow, too much or too little. The Neighborhood Council gives us the power to steer the process to help the whole community. As a Neighborhood Council Board Member I will seek to balance the needs of residents and businesses, renters and owners, newcomers and longtime residents. Together we can keep Union Square a thriving, sustainable neighborhood with room for all - parks and stores, cars and bikes, seniors and kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Abdul Latif    | Renter, open seat                                 | I have lived in Union Square for over a year, and it has become home. I’ve been taught that serving one’s neighbors is a duty, and this has led me to run for the council. As a student living with many young professionals, I believe I can speak to the experience of many of Union Square’s residents, and find ways for the student and youth population give back to the community. I am committed to working for populations left behind by gentrification and creating an accepting cohesive community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Afruza Akther  | Worker, organization member, immigrant, open seat | I am an immigrant from Bangladesh. I lived in Union Square for 10 years with my husband and daughter. I used to work here too, at Subway. I lost my job and home last year, because of rent increases. I had to move my daughter’s school and she is sad about it. My family cares about this community and we love being here.,Now I live in Magoun Square and I work at Nu Café. I have been very involved since the beginning of the Union Square redevelopment with Union United, and I am on the UU steering committee. I have personally experienced the issues in Union Square so I understand them and I can help other people fight for community benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Andrea Lizama  | Worker, open seat                                 | ‪I want to be the medium which young people feel comfortable talking through. ‬Working at Groundwork Somerville has given me a new perspective of the role of teenagers in our community; it's difficult to speak your piece when you don't feel like you're being heard. And that simply isn't true, there are ways to get your voice out there, and there are people who care about making sure everyone's voice is heard, and joining the Council is one of those ways. Not every teenager in Somerville can be on the board, it's impractical, but one voice, that's all it takes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Andy Greenspon | Homeowner, organization member, open seat         | I have been involved in local community actions since I moved to Union Square 4 1/2 years ago. I've provided critical feedback to the city about the Union Square Neighborhood Plan and Zoning overhaul - both of which will form the template for new development in the coming years. I’m also a scientist and hope to bring a unique perspective and attention to detail to ensuring new developments provide the most benefit possible to current and displaced members of the community. I have spent many hours over the past year providing input towards forming a Neighborhood Council with the vision, mission, and goals as stated. I hope to continue that work representing the broad community’s goals for responsible development, affordable housing, jobs, green and open space, traffic mitigation, and concerns of those in the Square. I want this organization to bridge different viewpoints and find common ground among all those who aspire for Union Square to continue to be the diverse and engaged community that it is. I’m happy to talk with anyone at any time about their hopes and dreams for the Square. |
| Ann Camara     | Homeowner, business owner, open seat              | I am a civic minded girl from a blue collar family. I came to live in my grandparents’ house in Duck Village 41 years ago. Somerville is my home. I raised my two sons here, ran a home day care, taught CCD at St. Joseph’s, and joined the community. I want to be a leader in the Union Square NC. I am inclusive, transparent, and a doer.,Now that the property values are increasing, our people can’t afford to stay. This council will be about preventing displacement and bringing community benefits to the neighborhood. I have been part of the NC working group and I want to bring my knowledge to the board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Athena Moore   | Renter, open seat                                 | I’ve been a resident of Union Square, artist at Washington Street Art, and member of SCATV since 2011. In that time, I’ve seen a huge amount of change. Much of this has been encouraging, but other areas need attention. I believe strongly in inclusion, intersectionality, and affordability, and believe it’s critical that we focus on open discussion and work in these areas so that we’re able to make solid, deliberate decisions for our diverse population. I want to protect the vitality of both the physical space that we occupy here and the residents that live in and love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Ben Baldwin    | Renter, open seat                                 | Greetings, Union Square community! I am a 3+ year renter and resident of Union Square and a resident of Somerville for five. My professional background includes science, education, and urban planning. I am a local musician and supporter of Somerville Arts programs, such as Open Studios and Porchfest. I received a Masters in urban planning and environmental policy from Tufts University and currently work as a community organizer, developing affordable housing and farms at a nonprofit in Roxbury. I look forward to putting these skills and experiences to use in advocating for an affordable, sustainable, and accessible Union Square!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Ben Bradlow    | Renter, open seat                                 | I am a first-generation American. My wife, Fenna, and I are expecting a child and are looking forward to raising our family in Union Square. My professional training is in city planning at MIT. I have a decade of experience researching and working with communities to negotiate with developers and city governments to make development inclusive. Development should benefit all Union Square residents. This means minimizing displacement, and ensuring that new development improves opportunities for current residents to live and work here. I know that there is a diversity of interests that come with development. I will work as a founding Neighborhood Council member to build bridges across these concerns and to ensure that the Council is an institution where everyone feels that they are represented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Bill Cavellini | Renter, open seat                                 | I have lived one and a half blocks from the proposed T station for 13 years. I have a Bachelor of Architecture and experience evaluating large real estate developments and their effects on surrounding neighborhoods. I was a tenant organizer, an advocate for affordable housing, and a co-founder of two community gardens. The new development in Union Square will determine what the future looks like for my two grand daughters who go to neighborhood public schools. This is one of the main reasons I got involved in Union Square organizing over 1 ½ years ago. My work with Union United and the Neighborhood Council Working Group proves that I am willing to put in the time and effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Over the twenty-nine years that I’ve pursued them, this moment holds the greatest opportunities and the greatest threats for achieving them. I am running to realize the opportunities and manage the threats.
While my hard skills are in community-based economic development, my overarching commitment is to sustain, extend, and strengthen the bonds of community among our diverse neighbors. Anyone who wishes to know my positions on housing, jobs, displacement, community, empowerment, urban design, and open space may read them in Somerville Times columns that I’ve written.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|Cheri Ruane                |Homeowner, open seat                                       |With only 15 years of Union Square residence under my belt, I’m often told I’m “new around here.” As a homeowner, mom, and designer of many of Somerville’s public open spaces through my profession as a landscape architect I believe I have a worthwhile perspective that can bolster the mission of the Union Square Neighborhood Council. I participated as a “Strategy Leader” through some of the US2 negotiations and could see first-hand the diversity and complexity of the issues facing Union Square today. Our collective voice will inform the Union Square of tomorrow; diverse, vibrant, and accessible to all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
