| Aaron Weber | Homeowner, organization member, open seat | Union Square redevelopment offers us the opportunity to shape the neighborhood for decades to come. It also poses risks: it can be too fast or too slow, too much or too little. The Neighborhood Council gives us the power to steer the process to help the whole community. As a Neighborhood Council Board Member I will seek to balance the needs of residents and businesses, renters and owners, newcomers and longtime residents. Together we can keep Union Square a thriving, sustainable neighborhood with room for all - parks and stores, cars and bikes, seniors and kids. |
| Abdul Latif | Renter, open seat                         | I have lived in Union Square for over a year, and it has become home. I’ve been taught that serving one’s neighbors is a duty, and this has led me to run for the council. As a student living with many young professionals, I believe I can speak to the experience of many of Union Square’s residents, and find ways for the student and youth population give back to the community. I am committed to working for populations left behind by gentrification and creating an accepting cohesive community.                                                                          |
