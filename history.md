## Background

#### LOCUS, CAC, and the Neighborhood Council Working Group

All three of these groups have been working for years toward the same goal: To create a representative body for Union Square that-- to paraphrase Mayor Curtatone: 

* Protects community values
* Prevents displacement
* Ensures community's shared goals will help shape Union Square's future.
* The process has been one of broadening engagement: from appointed bodies, to volunteer working groups, to an inclusive stakeholder model.
