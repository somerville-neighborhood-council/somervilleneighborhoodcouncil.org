## Editing this site

This site is constructed from a set of text files using "Markdown" format, which is fairly close to plain text. You will need a GitHub account to propose changes.

To propose changes to the front page [click this link](https://github.com/union-square-neighborhood-council/unionsquareneighborhoodcouncil.org/edit/master/index.md)

A quick primer on Markdown:

Links are represented using square brackets followed by a URL in parentheses (with no spaces):

```
[The displayed link text](http://the-url.com)
```

Headers are represented using `#` marks:

```
## A Header

### A Subheader
```

Regular text is just typed in, but you need an empty line between every piece of content, like this:

```
### A header

Some text in a paragraph.

A new paragraph.

### Another header

Another paragraph

* a bulleted list
* a list item
* another list item
```

If you'd like a change made but don't know how, you can also [open an issue](https://github.com/union-square-neighborhood-council/unionsquareneighborhoodcouncil.org/issues/new) and I'm happy to help.
