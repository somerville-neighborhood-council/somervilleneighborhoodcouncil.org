Ad hominem attacks, verbally abusive remarks, and comments intended to insult, disrespect, demean, or disparage a person, whether present or not, are inconsistent with the meeting environment and spirit of collaboration that we are working to create.  Such remarks and comments will not be tolerated, and participants who make such remarks, whether at full group meetings or meetings of committees or subcommittees convened to conduct group business, will be asked to immediately leave that meeting.
 
Threatening and violent behavior will likewise not be tolerated.  Perpetrators will be expected to immediately leave the meeting at which they have exhibited such behavior.
 
In the absence of authority to ban the perpetrator of such behavior from one or more future meetings, the group can inform the perpetrator that they are not welcome to attend one or more future meetings of the full group and its committees, and that if they do attend, they will be encouraged to leave.  If they nonetheless remain, they will not be called upon to speak.
 
The full complement of ground rules should be reviewed at the beginning of any full group or committee meeting, and anyone who cannot agree to those rules should be encouraged to leave.
 
Members of our group who have expertise in establishing and enforcing codes of conduct have offered to help us in further navigating the process of creating a safe and respectful space for participants to work together.
